# thesis-latex-template
I am a student of the Munich University of Applied Sciences and therefore this template also has logos of this university. But it is very simple to change the logo. This template is completely in german but you have to edit only a few specifications to change the language to whatever language you like. Feel free to copy this template but I would appreciate if you report errors if you find some.
